# Run standard SQL directly
- `dbt run`
- invoke macros `run_query` with `dbt run-operation`
- Use [hooks](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/hooks-operations#about-hooks) inside model file 


# Common Table Expression (CTE)
- A temporary result set available for use until the end of SQL script execution. 
- You can think of a CTE as a separate, smaller query within the larger query youâ€™re building up.
  - like making a temporary [view](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/view) that you can access throughout the rest of the query you are writing.
- Use CTEs by the `with` keyword
